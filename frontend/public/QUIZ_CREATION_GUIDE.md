# üìö How to Add Your Own Quizzes to Unbabel Mind

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for creating custom quizzes in Unbabel Mind! This guide will walk you through the entire process of adding your own reading and listening quizzes with questions, answers, and evidence.

{Quiz creation workflow diagram showing the three main file types and their relationships}

## üéØ What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to:
- ‚úÖ Create reading passages and audio transcripts
- ‚úÖ Design various question types (True/False/Not Given, Multiple Choice, Fill-in-the-blank)
- ‚úÖ Provide correct answers and supporting evidence
- ‚úÖ Structure your quiz data properly
- ‚úÖ Test and deploy your custom quizzes

## üìÅ Understanding the File Structure

Each quiz in Unbabel Mind consists of **three essential files**:

```
frontend/public/static/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reading/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [quiz_id]_[type].txt      # üìÑ Reading passage
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [quiz_id]_[type]_q.json   # ‚ùì Questions and answers
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [quiz_id]_[type]_e.json   # üîç Evidence for answers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ listening/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [quiz_id]_[type].txt      # üéß Audio transcript
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [quiz_id]_[type]_q.json   # ‚ùì Questions and answers
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [quiz_id]_[type]_e.json   # üîç Evidence for answers
```

### File Naming Convention
- **Quiz ID**: A unique identifier (e.g., `20`, `21`, `22`)
- **Type**: The question type number (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`)
- **Example**: `20_1.txt` = Quiz 20, Type 1

{File structure diagram showing the three files and their purposes}

## üìÑ Step 1: Creating the Passage/Transcript File

### For Reading Quizzes (`[quiz_id]_[type].txt`)

Create a text file with the following structure:

```txt
Title of Your Reading Passage

Your reading passage content goes here. This should be a comprehensive text that provides enough information for students to answer the questions you'll create later.

The passage should be well-structured with clear paragraphs and contain factual information that can be used to create various types of questions.

Make sure your content is engaging and appropriate for the target audience level.
```

### For Listening Quizzes (`[quiz_id]_[type].txt`)

Create a transcript file with the same structure:

```txt
Title of Your Audio Transcript

This is the transcript of the audio that students will listen to. It should contain all the spoken content, including:

- Speaker dialogue
- Descriptions of sounds or actions
- Any relevant background information
- Clear markers for different speakers if applicable

The transcript should match exactly what students hear in the audio recording.
```

## ‚ùì Step 2: Creating Questions (`[quiz_id]_[type]_q.json`)

This is the most important file! It contains all your questions, answer options, and correct answers.

### Question Types Supported

1. **Intro** - Instructions for a question section
2. **Subheading** - Section headers
3. **True/False/Not Given (TFNG)** - True/False/Not Given questions
4. **Single Choice** - Multiple choice with one correct answer
5. **Multi Choice** - Multiple choice with multiple correct answers
6. **Fill-in-line** - Fill in the blank questions

### JSON Structure

```json
[
  {
    "type": "intro",
    "text": "Questions 1-6\n\nDo the following statements agree with the information given in Reading Passage 1?\nIn boxes 1‚Äì6 on your answer sheet, write\nTRUE           if the statement agrees with the information\nFALSE         if the statement contradicts the information\nNOT GIVEN  if there is no information on this"
  },
  {
    "type": "tfng",
    "number": 1,
    "question": "Your question text here?",
    "options": ["TRUE", "FALSE", "NOT GIVEN"],
    "correctAnswer": "TRUE"
  },
  {
    "type": "single",
    "number": 2,
    "question": "What is the main purpose of this passage?",
    "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    "correctAnswer": "Option A"
  },
  {
    "type": "multi",
    "number": 3,
    "question": "Which of the following are mentioned in the passage?",
    "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    "correctAnswer": ["Option A", "Option C"]
  },
  {
    "type": "subheading",
    "text": "Section Title"
  },
  {
    "type": "fill-in-line",
    "number": 4,
    "text": "The answer is ____ and the result is ____.",
    "correctAnswer": "correct"
  }
]
```

### Question Type Details

## üîç Step 3: Creating Evidence (`[quiz_id]_[type]_e.json`)

The evidence file provides supporting text from the passage/transcript that justifies each correct answer.

### JSON Structure

```json
[
  {
    "number": 1,
    "text": "This is the specific text from the passage that supports the correct answer for question 1."
  },
  {
    "number": 2,
    "text": "This is the specific text from the passage that supports the correct answer for question 2."
  },
  {
    "number": 3,
    "text": "This is the specific text from the passage that supports the correct answer for question 3."
  }
]
```

### Evidence Guidelines

- **Be Specific**: Quote the exact text that supports the answer
- **Be Concise**: Keep evidence focused and relevant
- **Include Context**: Provide enough context to understand the answer
- **Match Question Numbers**: Each evidence entry should correspond to a question number

## üìã Example: Complete Quiz Creation

Let's create a complete example quiz about "Climate Change":

### 1. Passage File (`21_1.txt`)
```txt
Climate Change: A Global Challenge

Climate change represents one of the most significant challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. The Earth's average temperature has increased by approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.

The primary greenhouse gas responsible for global warming is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is released when we burn coal, oil, and natural gas for energy. Other significant greenhouse gases include methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, creating what is known as the greenhouse effect.

The consequences of climate change are already visible worldwide. Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense, and many species are struggling to adapt to changing conditions. The Arctic is warming at twice the global average rate, leading to melting ice caps and permafrost.

Scientists have identified several key solutions to address climate change. Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can replace fossil fuels. Energy efficiency measures can reduce overall energy consumption. Reforestation and forest conservation can help absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.

Individual actions also play a crucial role in combating climate change. Simple steps such as using energy-efficient appliances, reducing car travel, and supporting sustainable products can make a significant difference when adopted by millions of people worldwide.
```
